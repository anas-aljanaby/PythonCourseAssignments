# Assignment 5: User Input Loop

# Let's begin by asking the user to type either 'p' or 'q'. You know how to do this using input()
user_input = "q"

# TODO: Begin a while loop that runs for as long as the user doesn't type 'q'.
# Inside the loop, have an if statement that checks if the user typed 'p'.
#    If they did, print "Hello"
# Still inside the loop, ask the user again for input

while user_input != 'q':
    pass  # Remove this line and implement the loop logic here
