# Assignment 2: Greeting and Age in Months

# TODO: Ask the user for their name and store it in a variable called 'name'.
name = None

# TODO: Print out the greeting "Hello, NAME"

age = None

# TODO: Calculate the number of months the age represents and store it in a variable called 'months'.
months = None

# TODO: Print out the number of months.
# For example, if the age is 25, the output should be "300 months."
