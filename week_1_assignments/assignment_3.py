# Assignment 3: Nearby Friends

# Provided sets
nearby_people = {'Rolf', 'Jen', 'Anna'}
user_friends = set()  # This is an empty set, like {}

# TODO: Ask the user for the name of a friend and store it in a variable called 'friend_name'.
friend_name = None

# TODO: Add the name to the 'user_friends' set.
# Hint: use the add() method to add an item to a set.

# TODO: Print out the intersection between 'nearby_people' and 'user_friends'.
# The intersection will give you a set of friends who are nearby.
