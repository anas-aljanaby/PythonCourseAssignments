A player looks like this:

{
    'name': 'PLAYER_NAME',
    'numbers': {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
}

Define a list with two players (you can come up with their names and numbers).

# TODO: Define the players list with two players. Each player should have a 'name' and a set of 'numbers'.
players = []

"""
For each of the two players, print out a string like this: "Player PLAYER_NAME got 3 numbers right.".
Of course, replace PLAYER_NAME by their name, and the 3 by the amount of numbers they matched with lottery_numbers.
You'll have to access each player's name and numbers, and calculate the intersection of their numbers with lottery_numbers.
Then construct a string and print it out.

Remember: the string must contain the player's name and the amount of numbers they got right!
"""
# TODO: For each player, calculate how many numbers they got right, and print the result.
